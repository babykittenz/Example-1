QUESTION ONE

1. There is only one real reason that is preventing the plugin from being seen on the admin side. We need to Add the initial plugin registration in the comment section at the top of hello-world.php 

2. This plugin would hook in Hello World as a title tag at the start of the content. 

 I would also not it is good practice to add all of these things when setting up a boilerplate for plugins. 
    - Added the plugin initiation at the top of the file
    - Disable direct access to the file
    - Allow for Translation
    - Continue with plugin code
